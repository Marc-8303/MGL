# MGL Webpage
MGL Webpage It's a static website (HTML + CSS + JavaScript) that combines several interactive mini-games that can be run directly in the browser without installing anything.
The goal is to offer a quick and easy gaming experience: just choose a game, and play—no accounts, no logins, and no downloads.

## Key Features

- 🔍 **Game Selector**: Home page with cards showing every available game.
- 🎮 **Fully client-side games**: vanilla JavaScript logic, no backend.
- 📱 **Responsive design**: adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- 🌙 **Light/Dark Theme**: button to switch between themes.
- 🚀 **Auto-deployment**: every push to the `main` branch is published to GitHub Pages.
