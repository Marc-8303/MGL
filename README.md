# MGL Webpage
MGL Webpage It's a static website (HTML + CSS + JavaScript) that combines several interactive mini-games that can be run directly in the browser without installing anything.
The goal is to offer a quick and easy gaming experience: just choose a game, and playâ€”no accounts, no logins, and no downloads.
